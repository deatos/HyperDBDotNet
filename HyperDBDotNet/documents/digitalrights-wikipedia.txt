'''Digital rights''' are those [[human rights]] and [[Natural and legal rights|legal rights]] that allow individuals to access, use, create, and publish [[digital media]] or to access and use [[computer]]s, other [[Consumer electronics|electronic devices]], and [[telecommunications network]]s. The concept is particularly related to the protection and realization of existing rights, such as the [[right to privacy]] and [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], in the context of  digital technologies, especially the [[Internet]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/encryption/58154.stm | work=BBC News | title=Digital freedom: the case for civil liberties on the Net | date=1999-03-04 | access-date=2010-05-01 | archive-date=2016-03-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171032/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/encryption/58154.stm | url-status=live }}</ref> The laws of several countries recognize a [[right to Internet access]].<ref name="cjicl.com">{{Cite journal|last=Lucchi|first=Nicola|date=2011-02-06|title=Access to Network Services and Protection of Constitutional Rights: Recognizing the Essential Role of Internet Access for the Freedom of Expression|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1756243|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=1756243|access-date=2020-12-03|archive-date=2023-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230117060740/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1756243|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Human rights and the Internet ==
A number of [[human rights]] have been identified as relevant with regard to the [[Internet]]. These include [[freedom of expression]], [[privacy]], and [[freedom of association]]. Furthermore, the [[right to education]] and [[multilingualism]], [[consumer rights]], and capacity building in the context of the [[right to development]] have also been identified.<ref>Benedek 2008, 17 November 2011</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Minjeong|last2=Choi|first2=Dongyeon|date=2018|title=Development of Youth Digital Citizenship Scale and Implication for Educational Setting|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26273877|journal=Journal of Educational Technology & Society|volume=21|issue=1|pages=155–171|jstor=26273877|issn=1176-3647|access-date=2020-11-15|archive-date=2020-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005094733/https://www.jstor.org/stable/26273877|url-status=live}}</ref>
<blockquote>
According to an editorial in the journal ''La Civilta Cattolica'' the [[Internet]] is a global public good that should be accessible to all and respectful of the rights of others. With repressive regimes restricting [[access to information]] and communications, democratic governments should work to guarantee access to the Internet and adopt general principles to ensure network use respects universal human rights.

"What the law permits or prohibits offline must also be the case online ... The "only widespread international consensus" on online material to be censored regards child pornography and cyberterrorism. The article continued, saying that with individuals abusing the freedom of expression, with companies potentially exploiting computer users for financial gain and repressive regimes blocking information from their citizens, the world needs a "Charter of Human Rights for the Internet".

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] has criticized the [[United States government]] for considering during the [[Megaupload]] seizure process that people lose [[property right]]s by storing data on a cloud computing service.<ref>[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/governments-attack-cloud-computing Megaupload and the Government's Attack on Cloud Computing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123025643/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/governments-attack-cloud-computing |date=2017-11-23 }} - Electronic Frontier Foundation, October 31, 2012</ref>

==Ensuring that access is broadly available and/or preventing unreasonable restrictions==

Several countries have adopted laws that require the state to work to ensure that Internet access is broadly available and/or preventing the state from unreasonably restricting an individual's access to information and the Internet:
* [[Costa Rica]]: A 30 July 2010 ruling by the Supreme Court of Costa Rica stated: "Without fear of equivocation, it can be said that these technologies [information technology and communication] have impacted the way humans communicate, facilitating the connection between people and institutions worldwide and eliminating barriers of space and time. At this time, access to these technologies becomes a basic tool to facilitate the exercise of fundamental rights and democratic participation (e-democracy) and citizen control, education, freedom of thought and expression, access to information and public services online, the right to communicate with government electronically and administrative transparency, among others. This includes the fundamental right of access to these technologies, in particular, the right of access to the Internet or World Wide Web."<ref>[http://200.91.68.20/pj/scij/busqueda/jurisprudencia/jur_texto_sentencia.asp?nValor2=483874&tem1=013141&param7=0&lResultado=3&nValor1=1&strTipM=T&strLib=LIB "Judgement 12790 of the Supreme Court"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217120514/http://200.91.68.20/pj/scij/busqueda/jurisprudencia/jur_texto_sentencia.asp?nValor2=483874&tem1=013141&param7=0&lResultado=3&nValor1=1&strTipM=T&strLib=LIB |date=2015-12-17 }}, File 09-013141-0007-CO, 30 July 2010.

<blockquote>
We reaffirm the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the [[right to development]], as enshrined in the [[Vienna Declaration]]. We also reaffirm that [[democracy]], [[sustainable development]], and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as good governance at all levels are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. We further resolve to strengthen the rule of law in international as in national affairs.
</blockquote>

The WSIS Declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of the right to [[freedom of expression]] in the "[[information society|Information Society]]" in stating:<ref name="Murray" />

<blockquote>
We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information Society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers.

The 2004 WSIS Declaration of Principles also acknowledged that "it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources and technologies for criminal and terrorist purposes, while respecting human rights".<ref>{{Cite book| last1 = Klang| first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age| year = 2005| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=USksfqPjwhUC&q=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights| publisher = Routledge| page = 2| isbn = 9781904385318| access-date = 2021-11-29| archive-date = 2023-01-17| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230117060742/https://books.google.com/books?id=USksfqPjwhUC&q=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights| url-status = live}}</ref> Wolfgang Benedek comments that the WSIS Declaration only contains a number of references to human rights and does not spell out any procedures or mechanism to assure that human rights are considered in practice.<ref name="Benedek 2008 36">{{cite book |title=Internet Governance and the Information Society |last=Benedek |first=Wolfgang |author2=Veronika Bauer |author3=Matthias Kettemann |year=2008 |publisher=Eleven International Publishing |isbn=978-90-77596-56-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ie7Yqiw85TcC&q=%22digital+rights%22+%22human+rights%22 |page=36 |access-date=2021-11-29 |archive-date=2023-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230117060743/https://books.google.com/books?id=ie7Yqiw85TcC&q=%22digital+rights%22+%22human+rights%22 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Global Network Initiative ==
On October 29, 2008, the [[Global Network Initiative]] (GNI) was founded upon its "Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy". The Initiative was launched in the 60th Anniversary year of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for [[human rights]] on [[freedom of expression]] and [[privacy]] set out in the UDHR, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR).<ref>[http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php Global Network Initiative, FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309234331/http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php |date=2009-03-09 }}</ref> Participants in the Initiative include the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], other major companies, human rights NGOs, investors, and academics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news|title=News|website=Human Rights Watch|language=en|access-date=2019-06-19|archive-date=2019-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824131556/https://www.hrw.org/news|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://globalnetworkinitiative.org/participants/|title=Participants|website=globalnetworkinitiative.org|access-date=2019-06-19|archive-date=2018-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219045357/http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/participants/index.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

*Nearly four in five (78%) Internet users felt that the Internet had brought them greater freedom.
*Opinions of users were divided by country of origin. Those in Europe and China believed in some regulation of the internet by the government. However, South Koreans and Nigerians did not agree with government involvement in internet regulation. In the UK, 55% of users supported at least some regulation of the internet.
*Opinion was evenly split between Internet users who felt that "the internet is a safe place to express my opinions" (48%) and those who disagreed (49%).
*The aspects of the Internet that cause the most concern include: [[fraud]] (32%), violent and explicit content (27%), threats to [[privacy]] (20%), state [[censorship]] of content (6%), and the extent of corporate presence (3%).
*Almost four in five Internet users and non-users around the world felt that access to the Internet was a fundamental right (50% strongly agreed, 29% somewhat agreed, 9% somewhat disagreed, 6% strongly disagreed, and 6% gave no opinion).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8548190.stm "Internet access is 'a fundamental right'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107075123/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8548190.stm |date=2012-01-07 }}, ''BBC News'', 8 March 2010</ref>

==Recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur==
The 88 recommendations made by the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in a May 2011 report to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] include several that bear on the question of Internet access:<ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf "VI. Conclusions and recommendations"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402152208/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf |date=2012-04-02 }}, ''Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue'', Human Rights Council, Seventeenth session
Agenda item 3, United Nations General Assembly, 16 May 2011</ref>
:67. Unlike any other medium, the Internet enables individuals to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds instantaneously and inexpensively across national borders. By vastly expanding the capacity of individuals to enjoy their right to freedom of opinion and expression, which is an "enabler" of other human rights, the Internet boosts economic, social and political development, and contributes to the progress of humankind as a whole. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages other Special Procedures mandate holders to engage on the issue of the Internet with respect to their particular mandates.
:78. While blocking and filtering measures deny users access to specific content on the Internet, States have also taken measures to cut off access to the Internet entirely. The Special Rapporteur considers cutting off users from Internet access, regardless of the justification provided, including on the grounds of violating intellectual property rights law, to be disproportionate and thus a violation of article 19, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
:79. The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to ensure that Internet access is maintained at all times, including during times of political unrest.
:85. Given that the Internet has become an indispensable tool for realizing a range of human rights, combating inequality, and accelerating development and human progress, ensuring universal access to the Internet should be a priority for all States. Each State should thus develop a concrete and effective policy, in consultation with individuals from all sections of society, including the private sector and relevant Government ministries, to make the Internet widely available, accessible and affordable to all segments of population.
